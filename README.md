# ðŸŒˆ Measuring the Balmer Series Using a Spectrometer

This repository contains experimental data and analysis related to the **Balmer Series** of hydrogen, obtained using a **spectrometer**. The Balmer Series consists of the visible spectral lines emitted by hydrogen atoms as electrons transition to the second energy level.

## ðŸ”¬ Project Overview

The goal of this experiment was to **measure and analyze the spectral lines of hydrogen** using a spectrometer and compute the **Balmer Series wavelengths**. By examining the spectral emissions, we can determine the **Rydberg constant** and validate quantum mechanical predictions.

### **Key Aspects of the Experiment:**
- **Spectrometer Setup**: Used to measure emission wavelengths.
- **Hydrogen Lamp**: Light source for observing the spectral lines.
- **Balmer Formula**: Used to compare observed wavelengths with theoretical values.
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted in R and presented in `.qmd` and `.pdf` files.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Spectral Data Collection**  
   - A spectrometer was used to measure the wavelengths of light emitted by a hydrogen lamp.
   - The emission lines were recorded in multiple trials for accuracy.

2. **Data Analysis in R**  
   - Observed wavelengths were compared with theoretical predictions from the Balmer formula:

   $$
   \frac{1}{\lambda} = R_H \left(\frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{n^2} \right)
   $$

   where \( R_H \) is the **Rydberg constant** and \( n \) is the principal quantum number.


3. **Results & Validation**  
   - The calculated wavelengths were compared with expected Balmer Series values.
   - The **Rydberg constant** was estimated based on the experimental data.
